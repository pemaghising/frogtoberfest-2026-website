            <p>
              Open to anyone based in Nepal only, since this challenge has always been about fostering the Nepali
              open source community.
            </p>
          </Faq>
          <Faq q="Do I need a team, or can I go solo?">
            <p>Join solo or as a team of 5 members maximum.</p>
            <p>
              Some of the best products are built by one person chasing an idea alone, while others come together
              as a team. Both are welcome, and neither gets special treatment in judging.
            </p>
          </Faq>
          <Faq q="What do I need to register?">
            <p>Your team, idea, and a public repo. Registration runs September 15&ndash;29.</p>
          </Faq>
          <Faq q="I don&rsquo;t have a concrete idea right now. What do I submit?">
            <p>Frogtoberfest is all about exploring and experimenting. This is a platform for you to get started.</p>
            <p>
              You can submit a vague idea or concept along with your repo, and build it throughout the challenge
              duration.

          <Faq q="Does my project need to be built from scratch?">
            <p>
              How you build it is up to you, but there&rsquo;s a hard rule on what you <em>build it with</em>.
              Since it&rsquo;s <strong>open-source</strong> and meant to <strong>open</strong> from end-to-end,
              only open-source or open-weight AI qualifies (e.g. Llama, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, self-hosted or
              via a hosted provider).
            </p>
            <p>
              Proprietary APIs like OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini are discouraged, even for small auxiliary calls.
              Document what you used, name the model, and disclose exactly where in your code its output gets
              consumed.
            </p>
          </Faq>
          <Faq q="Will Leapfrog provide funding, credits, or API keys?">
            <p>
              For starters, Leapfrog will host a virtual kickoff session with a webinar on How to Build with AI
              to help you navigate through the challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, financial support or API keys will <strong>not</strong> be provided.
            </p>
          </Faq>
          <Faq q="What actually counts as an &ldquo;open source, AI-powered product&rdquo;?">
            <p>
              The AI has to do real work inside your product, not just talk to the user. A baseline check would
              be: if you deleted the AI call from your codebase, would the product still do its job? If yes, it
              doesn&rsquo;t qualify.
            </p>
            <p>If no, AI is processing, deciding, or acting on something the rest of your system depends on, you&rsquo;re in.</p>

            <p>
              Submit what you have, and document what&rsquo;s missing. Evaluation weighs impact and quality, not
              just completeness, but without a public repo, a working demo, and documentation, there&rsquo;s
              nothing for judges to evaluate.

              Five (5). Every entry gets run through the eligibility gate and quick screen, but the top 5 move on
